# AI-based-Brain-Tumor-Detection

This project focuses on the usage of CNN, flask and IBM Watson to efficiently detect brain tumors in MRI images. 

Two approaches are plausible for the given scenario. The model can be developed on jupyter notebook and flask can be integrated with web user interface to make the application user-friendly. 

Another approach involves the use of IBM Watson studio to train the model, which can be downloaded using model id credentials and used. It can be found in the 'IBM Watson + Jupyter files' section.

# NOTE: 
Location for IBM Watson and the ML services is set to Dallas. While uploading datasets to IBM Watson Studio, ensure that the files are zipped.
When working with the flask-based application, ensure that a folder (initially empty) named 'uploads' exists.
